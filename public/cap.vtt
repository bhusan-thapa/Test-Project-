1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.190
If
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:00.460
you
00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:00.720
do
00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:01.190
research
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.967
it's
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:04.000
one
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.310
of
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:04.330
the
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:04.540
best
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:04.730
tools
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.480
that
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:04.830
I
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:04.930
have
00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:05.149
used
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.370
right
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:05.600
now

2
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:06.060
In
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:06.359
terms
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:06.590
of
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.500
giving
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.620
you
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.920
something
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:09.960
to
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:10.120
show
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.450
for
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.559
the
00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:10.839
research
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.050
you've
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:11.400
done

3
00:00:12.400 -->00:00:12.690
Whereas
00:00:12.700 -->00:00:12.959
before
00:00:12.960 -->00:00:13.040
it
00:00:13.059 -->00:00:13.469
takes
00:00:13.790 -->00:00:13.969
a
00:00:14.070 -->00:00:14.430
ton
00:00:14.429 -->00:00:14.599
of
00:00:14.620 -->00:00:15.219
work
00:00:15.400 -->00:00:16.260
to
00:00:16.549 -->00:00:16.909
take
00:00:16.940 -->00:00:17.930
everything
00:00:18.000 -->00:00:18.290
to
00:00:18.299 -->00:00:18.929
distill
00:00:18.930 -->00:00:19.230
what
00:00:19.469 -->00:00:19.549
has
00:00:19.549 -->00:00:20.130
been told to 
00:00:20.130 -->00:00:20.470
you

4
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:20.590
You
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:20.700
know
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.890
you
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:21.050
might
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.340
use
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.540
little
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.860
quotes
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:21.990
and
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.250
things
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.370
but
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.420
it
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.740
takes
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:22.790
a
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.030
ton
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.160
of
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.730
time
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.930
to
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:24.400
actually
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.889
communicate
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:25.180
that.

5
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.869
And
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:26.500
now
00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:28.089
I
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.270
can 
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:28.980
communicate
00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:31.119
the 
00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:31.519
research
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:31.669
that
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.800
we've
00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:32.329
done
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:33.100
through
00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.219
a
00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:33.769
handful
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.800
of
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.249
quotes
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.540
from
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.979
users
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.580
themselves

6
00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:36.279
And
00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:36.449
that
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.67
is
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.980
so
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:37.150
much
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.470
stronger
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:36.629
than
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.070
anything
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.170
I
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.350
can
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.740
tell
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.820
or
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.130
anything
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.200
I
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.330
can
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.550
put
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.900
into
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.280
a
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.160
PowerPoint.
